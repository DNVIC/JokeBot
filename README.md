# JokeBot
Python discord bot for rating peoples' jokes and establishing who makes the best jokes

If you want the bot, message me on discord(DNVIC#2075) and I'll check out your server to make sure it actually has people (This is because I host this from home, and I don't want this to be sitting in an empty discord)

You are free to host it yourself, however I'm not going to help you with problems.
# Official
Branch with the most stability, rigorously tested in both a developer server, and in actual servers.
# Have a problem?
Join _____ and tell us the problem. This is also the dev server with all 3 bots.
